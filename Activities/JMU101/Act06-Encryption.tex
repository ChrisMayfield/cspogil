%\section*{Context: Security and Privacy}

We learned last week how easy it can be to examine network packets (e.g., using Wireshark) and how insecure the Internet can be.
As a team, brainstorm for a few minutes what activities people do online that they would like to be kept secure and/or private.
List several examples in the space below, and then have your presenter write the two most important on the whiteboard.

\section*{Conclusion}

Modern encryption techniques (e.g., RSA and AES) are much more sophisticated than the shift ciphers we've looked at in this activity.
But the big idea is the same: you apply a ``key'' to some plaintext and transmit the resulting ciphertext.
