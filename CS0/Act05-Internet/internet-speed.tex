\model{Measuring Your Network}

Your network performance can be measured in two ways:

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt]
\item \textbf{bandwidth} -- the rate at which data is downloaded or uploaded to a network, measured in bits per second (bps), kilobits per second (kbps), or megabits per second (Mbps)
\item \textbf{latency} -- how much time it takes (in milliseconds) for a request to reach its destination
\end{itemize}

\Q Consider how performance should be measured:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For bandwidth, would good performance be a large number or a small number?
\ans[3em]{large}
\item For latency, would good performance be a large number or a small number?
\ans[3em]{small}
\end{enumerate}


\Q Use an Internet speed test (\url{https://www.google.com/search?q=speed+test}) to measure bandwidth here on campus and later at home.

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{enumerate}
\item On campus: \ans[10em]{6.63 Mbps}
\item At home:   \ans[10em]{9.32 Mbps}
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}


\Q Use Pingdom's speed test (\url{https://tools.pingdom.com/}) to measure the average latency between San Francisco and:
\begin{enumerate}
\item http://google.com     \ans[25em]{Performance grade: B 85, Load time: 1.55 s}
\item http://whitehouse.gov \ans[25em]{Performance grade: B 80, Load time: 1.54 s}
\item Any website you use   \ans[25em]{http://facebook.com takes 1.60 s}
\end{enumerate}


\Q Search for ``Internet speed by state'' and ``Internet speed by country'' to find the interactive maps on \href{https://www.fastmetrics.com/sitemap.php}{fastmetrics.com}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Which state in the US has the fastest \textbf{average peak speed}? Which state has the slowest?
\par\ans[465pt]{Delaware was the fastest, Kentucky was the slowest (when the map was created)}

\item What is the difference between the fastest and slowest states?
\par\ans[465pt]{75 Mbps $-$ 34 Mbps $=$ 41 Mbps (DE is more than twice as fast as KY)}

\item Which country has the fastest \textbf{average speed}? How does the US compare?
\par\ans[465pt]{South Korea has 26.7 Mbps; the US only has 14.2 Mbps}
\end{enumerate}
