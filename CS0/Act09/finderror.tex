\model{Finding \& Fixing Errors}

Estimate how long (seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or years) it typically takes to correct an error in software when it is found by:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|l|}
\hline
a. & a \textbf{compiler}, seconds after the file was edited
   & seconds
\\ \hline
b. & a \textbf{compiler}, later the same day or during a nightly build
   & hours/days
\\ \hline
c. & a \textbf{pair programming} partner, seconds after the error was made
   & \ans{seconds}
\\ \hline
d. & a \textbf{code review}, days or weeks after the file was edited
   & \ans{days/weeks}
\\ \hline
e. & a \textbf{customer} or other user, months after the software is released
   & \ans{months}
\\ \hline
f. & a \textbf{unit test}, minutes after the file was edited
   & \ans{minutes}
\\ \hline
g. & a \textbf{unit test}, later the same day or during a nightly build
   & \ans{hours/days}
\\ \hline
h. & a \textbf{system test}, shortly before software is released
     (weeks or months after the file was edited)
   & \ans{weeks/months}
\\ \hline
\end{tabularx}

\Q Describe (or sketch a graph of) the relationship between the time to \textbf{find an error} and the time and cost to \textbf{repair an error}.

\begin{answer}[10em]
The longer it takes to find an error, the longer and more costly is is to repair.

NOTE: Ambler (2009) and Boehm (1978) contain graphs of this relationship.
\end{answer}


\Q Explain why we should use an SDLC that finds and fixes errors as quickly as possible.

\begin{answer}
The faster we find errors, the faster and less expensive it is to fix them.
\end{answer}
