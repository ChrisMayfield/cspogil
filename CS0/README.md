# Contents

Each subfolder contains the LaTeX source for the activity.
Instructor's guides (content/process objectives, facilitation notes) are under development.

1. [Introduction](Act01) -- hi-lo game, algorithms and complexity, fast vs easy
2. [Data Storage](Act02) -- logic gates, digital circuits, binary and hexadecimal
3. [Program Execution](Act03) -- computer architecture and machine instructions
4. [Operating Systems](Act04) -- screenshots, interaction with apps and hardware
5. [Computer Networking](Act05) -- IP, DNS, bandwidth and latency, speed tests
6. [Information Security](Act06) -- basic encryption, Caesar cipher, Vigen√®re cipher
7. [Algorithms and Python](Act07) -- using IDLE, print, raw_input, guessing game
8. [Programming Languages](Act08) -- Y86-64 assembly vs Standard C vs Python
9. Software Engineering -- software dev life cycle, waterfall vs iterative
10. [Data Structures](Act10) -- contiguous arrays, indexes, linked lists, pointers, null
11. [Database Systems](Act11) -- select and project, Cartesian product and theta join
12. [Artificial Intelligence](Act12) -- 8-puzzle, tic-tac-toe, search trees, heuristics

Activity 9 has not yet been written; check back in Fall 2019.
I'm currently using Clif Kussmaul's "Software Dev Life Cycles" activity (see [cspogil.org](http://cspogil.org/Software%20Engineering)).

The [Meta](Meta) folder contains additional models for team development.
