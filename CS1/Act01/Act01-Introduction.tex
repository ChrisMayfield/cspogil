In this course, you will work in teams of 3--4 students to learn new concepts.
This activity will introduce you to the process.
We'll also take a first look at how to store data in Java programs.

\guide{
  \item Describe the responsibility of each POGIL role.
  \item Identify components of the "hello world" program.
  \item Write Java code to declare int and double variables.
  \item Explain what it means to assign a value to a variable.
}{
  \item Leveraging prior knowledge and experience of other students. (Teamwork)
}{
This activity is designed for the first day or week of CS1. There are no prerequisites. As the first activity, it's important to explain/model the instructor's role in a POGIL classroom. For large classes, it may take a bit longer than expected to organize teams.

\ref{team-roles.tex} refers to \github{Handouts/role-cards-mayfield.pdf}{Role Cards}, which ideally should be printed out on a different color of card stock (one set per team). You may also want to have each team complete a \github{Handouts/reflectors-report.pdf}{Reflector's Report} for this activity.

One strategy for reporting out \ref{hello-world.tex} is to have presenters of nearby teams swap answers and discuss any differences. Introduce the terms \emph{documentation} (see \ref{javadoc}) and \emph{newline} (see \ref{println}).

\ref{vardecl} and \ref{xgets} are good for reporting out. It's important that teams hear multiple perspectives on these concepts. Introduce the terms \emph{data type} and \emph{operator}, and point out that \emph{assignment} is not the same as \emph{equality}.

On \ref{assignment.tex}, it may be necessary to explain that there are only two variables. The boxes show the state of memory over time, as the corresponding statements are executed.
