\maketitle

In this course, you will work in teams of 3--4 students to learn new concepts.
This activity will introduce you to the process.
We'll also take a first look at how to store data in Java programs.

\guide{
  \item Describe the responsibility of each POGIL role.
  \item Explain each line of the "hello world" program.
  \item Write code to declare int and double variables.
  \item Explain what it means to assign a value to a variable.
}{
  \item Collaborate with team members to complete the activity. (Teamwork)

This activity is designed for the first day or week of CS1. There are no prerequisites. As the first activity, it's important to explain/model the instructor's role in a POGIL classroom. For large classes, it may take a bit longer than expected to organize teams.

Model 1 refers to \href{https://github.com/ChrisMayfield/cspogil/blob/master/Handouts/role-cards-mayfield.pdf}{Role Cards}, which ideally should be printed out on a different color of card stock (one set per team). You may also want to have each team complete a \href{https://github.com/ChrisMayfield/cspogil/blob/master/Handouts/reflectors-report.pdf}{Reflector's Report} for each activity.

When reporting out Model 2, introduce the terms \textbf{documentation} (question \#7) and \textbf{newline} (question \#8). Have presenters from neighboring teams swap answers and discuss differences.

Questions \#13 and \#20 are good for reporting out. It's important that teams see/hear multiple perspectives on these concepts. Introduce the terms \textbf{data type} and \textbf{operator}, and point out that assignment is not the same as equality.

On Model 4, it may be necessary to explain there are only two variables. The boxes show the state of memory over time, as the corresponding statements are executed.
