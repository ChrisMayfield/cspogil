**Acknowledgements**  
Models 3 and 4 are based on Model 1 of [Activity 02 - Declaration and Assignments](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tXPvWq7Zxd0HS4l7tOkB20SjApn8Zj4vwuMtPPrSI0I/pub) by Helen Hu.


## Facilitation Notes

Model 1 refers to the [Role Cards](../../Handouts/role-cards-mayfield.pdf), which ideally should be printed out on a differet color of cardstock (one set per team). You may also want to have each team complete a [Reflector's Report](../../Handouts/reflectors-report.pdf) (for each activity).

When reporting out Model 2, introduce the terms **documentation** (question #7) and **newline** (question #8). Have presenters from neighboring teams swap answers and discuss any differences.

Questions #13 and #20 are good for reporting out. It's important that teams see/hear multiple perspectives on these concepts. Introduce the terms **data type** and **operator**, and point out that assignment is not the same as equality.

On Model 4, it may be necesary to explain there are only two variables. The boxes show the state of memory over time, as the corresponding statements are executed.
