# Activity 2: Instructor's Guide

This activity focuses on integer and floating-point division and operator precedence. Students should understand how to declare and assign variables before completing this activity.

**Content Learning Objectives**  
*After completing this activity, students should be able to:*

* Evaluate Java expressions that use the % operator with integers.
* Explain the difference between integer and floating-point division.
* Identify operator precedence for addition, division, and assignment.

**Process Skill Goals**  
*During the activity, students should make progress toward:*

* Evaluate a Java command in the order a computer would execute it. (Information Processing)

## Facilitation Notes

Question #6 refers to the instructor (hypothetically) giving mints to teams to divide among themselves. Consider bringing mints to build rapport with the class, or you can use other small objects like pennies.

Report out on questions #7 and #8. Introduce the terms **modulo operation** (and/or **modulus**) and **remainder operator**. Explain that "x % y" can be pronounced "x mod y".

For question #18, have at least 2-3 teams share their answers with the class to encourage different ways of thinking about the concepts (and how to put them into words).

On Model 3, help students understand that assignment is an operation (as opposed to the equals sign in mathematics). At the end of the activity, ask teams to discuss what the operation is in terms of what comptuer hardware does.
