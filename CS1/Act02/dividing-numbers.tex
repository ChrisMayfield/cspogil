\Q In the first table, which number(s) divided by 4 evaluate to 3?
What is significant about the number of answers you have written down?

\begin{answer}
12, 13, 14, and 15.
There are four answers, because we divided by four.
\end{answer}


\Q How do the answers in the first table differ from the second table?

\begin{answer}
The second table is mathematically correct; the first table rounds down.
\end{answer}


\Q To the right of the second table, round each answer to the closest integer.
How do those values compare to what you see in the first table?

\begin{answer}
The pattern is off by two rows.
The 0.5 and 0.75 values round up, but in the first table they don't.
\end{answer}


\Q Carefully explain the difference between the number formats in the first and second tables.

\begin{answer}
All the numbers in the first table have no decimal points.
At least one number in each row of the second table as a decimal point.
\end{answer}


\Q Complete the table:
\hspace{2em}
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{tabular}[t]{|C{45pt}|C{65pt}|C{50pt}|}
\hline
14. / 4. & \textit{evaluates to} & \ans[3em]{3.5} \\
\hline
14. / 4  & \textit{evaluates to} & \ans[3em]{3.5} \\
\hline
14  / 4. & \textit{evaluates to} & \ans[3em]{3.5} \\
\hline
14  / 4  & \textit{evaluates to} & \ans[3em]{3}   \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}

\Q Dividing real numbers (also known as \emph{floating-point} numbers) gives you different results from dividing integers.
In the previous question:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Which rows evaluate to an integer? \ans{only the last row}

\item Which rows evaluate to a real number? \ans{the first three rows}

\item When will Java perform \emph{integer division}? \ans{when both numbers are integers}

\end{enumerate}


\Q Imagine you are writing a Java program that requires division.

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=1ex]

\item What must be true about the \emph{operands} (the numbers before and after the operator) for you to get the mathematically correct answer?

\begin{answer}[1em]
At least one of them needs to be a floating-point number.
\end{answer}

\item Does it need to be true for both operands? \ans[5em]{No}

\end{enumerate}


\Q Consider what you know about addition (\java{+}).
If you add two integers in Java, will the result always be mathematically correct?
Justify your answer.

\begin{answer}
Yes, because adding two integers always results in an integer.
(Unless the number gets too large and the arithmetic overflows.)
\end{answer}


\Q What about subtraction (\java{-}) and multiplication (\java{*})? If you subtract or multiply two integers in Java, will the answer always be mathematically correct? Justify your answer.

\begin{answer}
Yes, because subtraction and multiplication can be rewritten in terms of addition.
Division is the only special case, because it has both a quotient and a remainder.
\end{answer}


\Q \label{intdiv}
Summarize what you have learned about the difference between integer division and floating-point division.

\begin{answer}
Integer division simply ignores the decimal part of the answer, whereas floating-point division gives you the mathematically correct answer.
\end{answer}
