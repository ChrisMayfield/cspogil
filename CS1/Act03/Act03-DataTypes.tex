\maketitle

Java supports two main types of data: \emph{primitive types} like \java{int} and \java{double} that represent a single value, and \emph{reference types} like \java{String} and \java{Scanner} that represent more complex information.

\guide{
  \item Explain how using roles improves the team's success.
  \item Name Java's primitive data types and give examples of each one.
  \item Identify illegal assignment statements, and explain why they are illegal.
  \item Describe what it means for variables to store a reference to an object.
}{
  \item Providing feedback on how well other team members are working. (Teamwork)

It's important during \ref{disruptions.tex} to reinforce the importance of roles.
Successful teams are able to accomplish all the tasks outlined on the \github{Handouts/role-cards-mayfield.pdf}{Role Cards}, and there's too many things for one person to keep track of.
Ask the reflectors to pay special attention to their team during today's activity.

On \ref{literals}, students may struggle with letters used in primitive values (i.e., F and L).
Rather than explain what everything means, direct students back to \ref{primitive-types.tex} and have them read out loud the type names.
During report-out, introduce the term \emph{literal} and explain that \texttt{float} is a (broken) floating-point data type.
Ask students to figure out where the name \texttt{double} comes from.

\ref{allowed} is good for report-out, allowing students to collectively develop a rule for when an assignment is allowed.
It might be helpful to have a couple of examples handy to challenge their assumptions.
But be careful, examples like \texttt{short x = 3; byte y = 3; char c = 3;} may open a can of worms.
If these issues come up, you'll need to explain that \texttt{javac} will check the range of the value, and if it is acceptable, allow the assignment (i.e., \texttt{byte z = 255;} will fail).

\ref{reference-types.tex} introduces a standard technique for drawing diagrams of variables to show the difference between primitive and reference types.
On \ref{twostrs}, have 2--3 teams draw their diagrams on the board and address common misconceptions.
It may be helpful at this point to direct students to \href{http://pythontutor.com/java.html}{Java Tutor}, which draws similar diagrams (including stack frames).
This tool also has options for ``render all objects on the heap'' (instead of inlining) and ``use text labels for pointers'' (instead of drawing arrows), which can help reinforce the concept of memory addresses.
