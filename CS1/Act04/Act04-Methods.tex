\maketitle

Java programs are organized into {\em classes}, each of which has one or more {\em methods}, each of which has one or more {\em statements}.
Writing methods allows you to break down a complex program into smaller blocks of reusable code.

\guide{
  \item Apply methods from the Math class based on their documentation.
  \item Explain the syntax of a method declaration (parameters and return type).
  \item Draw a diagram that shows the call stack at a given point of execution.
}{
  \item Tracing the execution of methods to determine contents of memory. (Critical Thinking)
}{
This activity will likely take students longer than they think.
Remind managers to keep track of the time and presenters to be ready to report out.

\ref{math-methods.tex} introduces a number of terms, which you should model throughout facilitation.
\ref{println} and \ref{printf} are good for reporting out to reinforce the concepts of \emph{signature}, \emph{parameters}, and \emph{arguments}.
Students often confuse \texttt{printf} by using string concatenation within the format string.

\ref{invoke-return.tex} includes only void methods with no parameters, so that students may focus on the flow of execution.
For \ref{lines} and \ref{times}, do a quick check of each team's answer before they get too far along.
Some misread or misinterpret the question and/or don't get the difference between analyzing the code statically (i.e., how many lines) vs dynamically (i.e., how many times).

\ref{stack-diagrams.tex} builds on a previous method for drawing diagrams and memory traces (see Reference Types in Activity 3).
You may need to remind students that memory diagrams simply include a small box to the right of each variable name.
Have multiple teams draw their diagram for \ref{drawing} on the board to compare different ways students think about this question.
Address their misconceptions, and be sure to show the correct solution.
