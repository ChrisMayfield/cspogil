# Activity 4: Instructor's Guide

This activity focuses on methods: declaration, invocation, and call semantics.
It also introduces the Math class to illustrate parameters vs. arguments.
Model 3 builds on the previous activity for drawing diagrams and memory traces.

**Content Learning Objectives**  
*After completing this activity, students should be able to:*

* Identify the parts of a method declaration.
* Write a static method call given its signature and class it belongs to.
* Draw a memory diagram showing the stack at a given point of execution.

**Process Skill Goals**  
*During the activity, students should make progress toward:*

* Trace the execution of method calls to determine the contents of memory and the output of a program. (Information Processing)


## Facilitation Notes

For questions 1 and 2, do a quick check of each teams' answer before they get too far along.
Some misread or misinterpret the question and/or don't get the difference between analyzing the code statically (e.g., how many lines of source code ...) vs. dynamically (e.g., how many times ... when the program runs).

Questions 14 and 15 are good for reporting out, to reinforce the concepts of signature, parameters, and arguments.
Students often confuse printf by using string concatenation with the format string.

Quesiton 18 implicitly refers to Model 2 of the previous activity; you may need to remind students that memory diagrams simply include a box for each variable.

Have multiple teams draw their diagram for #20 on the board, to compare different ways students think about this question. Address misconceptions and be sure to show the correct solution.
