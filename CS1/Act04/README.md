# Activity 4: Instructor's Guide

This activity focuses on methods: declaration, invocation, call semantics,
memory model, and parameters vs. arguments.

**Content Learning Objectives**
*After completing this activity, students should be able to:*

* Identify the parts of a method declaration.
* Write a method call given its signature and class or object it belongs to.
* Trace the execution of method calls to determine the output of a program.
* Draw a state diagram showing the stack at a given point of execution.

**Process Skill Goals**
*During the activity, students should make progress toward:*

* TODO

## Facilitation Notes

* For questions 1 and 2, do a quick check of each teams' answer before they get
  too far along. Some misread or misinterpret the question and/or don't get the
  difference between analyzing the code statically (e.g., how many lines of
  source code ...) vs. dynamically (e.g., how many times ... when the program
  runs.). You can do this privately with each team, or you could do a quick
  report out and let teams explain why they came to the answer they did and see
  if that changes some teams' minds.
