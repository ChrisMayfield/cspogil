\maketitle

The primitive data type \java{boolean} has two values: \java{true} and \java{false}.
Boolean expressions are built using \emph{relational operators} and \emph{conditional operators}.

\guide{
  \item Recognize the value of developing process skills.
  \item Evaluate boolean expressions with relational operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=).
  \item Explain the difference between assignment (=) and equality (==) operators.
  \item Evaluate boolean expressions that involve comparisons with \&\&, ||, and !.
}{
  \item Evaluating complex logic expressions based on operator precedence. (Critical Thinking)
}{
\ref{employers.tex} is ultimately about process skills and should help with student buy-in.
If you are using the \github{Handouts/role-cards-mayfield.pdf}{Role Cards}, have students look at the definitions on the reverse side.
Each activity targets specific ``process skill goals'' from these categories.

\ref{relational.tex} mentions DrJava, but it can be replaced with another IDE or \href{http://www.javarepl.com/}{Java REPL}.
Give students about three minutes to fill in the table without using a computer.
Then show them the actual results interactively (or in an example program) on the projector.

When reporting out, ask students to explain what \emph{expressions} are and how they differ from \emph{statements}.
Reinforce what it means to \emph{evaluate} an expression (i.e., compute a single value) versus \emph{execute} a statement (i.e., run an entire line of code).

During \ref{conditional.tex}, explain that the variables $p$ and $q$ are often used to represent logic values in discrete math.
Make sure students understand that ! is a \emph{unary} operator, and that \java{&&} and \java{||} are \emph{binary} operators.
