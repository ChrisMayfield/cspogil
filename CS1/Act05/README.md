# Activity 5: Instructor's Guide

This activity introduces relational and conditional operators with a focus on evaluating boolean expressions.
It also includes two case studies of students who cheated on assignments that were supposed to be done individually.

**Content Learning Objectives**  
*After completing this activity, students should be able to:*

* Evaluate boolean expressions with relational operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=).
* Explain the difference between the assignment (=) and equality (==) operators.
* Evaluate boolean expressions that involve comparisons with &&, ||, and !.

**Process Skill Goals**  
*During the activity, students should make progress toward:*

* Analyze evidence in case studies to determine how students may have cheated. (critical thinking)

**Acknowledgements**  
Models 1 and 2 are based on Models 2 and 3 of [Activity 04 - Boolean](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tXPvWq7Zxd0HS4l7tOkB20SjApn8Zj4vwuMtPPrSI0I/pub) by Helen Hu.


## Facilitation Notes

Model 1 refers specifically to DrJava, but it can be replaced with other IDEs.
Give students about five minutes to fill in the table without using a computer.
Then show them the actual results interactively (or in an example program).

When reporting out, ask students to explain what **expressions** are and how they differ from **statements**.
Reinforce what it means to **evaluate** expressions (i.e., compute a value) versus **execute** statements.

For Model 2, explain that the variables *p* and *q* are often used to represent logic values in discrete math.
Make sure students understand that ! is a unary operator, and that && and || are binary operators.

Models 3 and 4 are based on true stories, unfortunately.
Each team should have a copy of the [Honor Code](../../Handouts/jmu-honor-code.pdf) or your own institution's policy.
20 minutes are allocated, but in practice it can take much less time.
