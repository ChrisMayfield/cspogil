\maketitle

Computers are often used to perform repetitive tasks.
Running the same statements over and over again, without making any mistakes, is something that computers do very well.

\guide{
  \item Explain what happens when re-assigning a variable.
  \item Identify the three main components of a while loop.
  \item Implement the factorial function using a for loop.
}{
  \item Tracing the execution of while/for loops and predict their final output. (Critical Thinking)
}{
\ref{assignment.tex} addresses two misconceptions about assignment: what happens when you reassign a variable, and how do you swap two variables. This understanding is essential for loop updates.

Consider bringing a pair of note cards labeled with a large 1 on the first and a large 2 on the second card.
Have all team members put one hand behind their back, and then hand the cards to two students (student $X$ gets the 1 and student $Y$ gets the 2).
Ask them to exchange cards, and if they struggle, say ``What if you had a student $Z$ who could help?''

When reporting out \ref{while-loops.tex}, have teams predict the answers to \ref{output}, \ref{value}, and \ref{do99}.
Then execute the code and have them discuss their results, if incorrect.
Consider stepping through the code with a debugger (on the projector) during report-out.

Be sure to make connections between the flow charts in \ref{while-loops.tex} and \ref{for-loops.tex}.
You may need to guide students on \ref{forchar} applying string methods in the context of a loop.
On \ref{nested}, students might not think to use a {\tt long} variable to store the factorial.
If time permits, show the output of the solution with {\tt fact} declared as an {\tt int}, and ask them to fix the code.
