# Activity 6: Instructor's Guide

This activity is a first introduction to recursion using two mathematical examples: factorial and summation.
Students learn how to read and trace recursive methods, not how to formulate recursive solutions to problems.

**Content Learning Objectives**  
*After completing this activity, students should be able to:*

* Identify the base case and recursive step in the factorial method.
* Explain what happens (in memory) when a method calls itself.
* Trace a recursive method by hand and predict its final output.

**Process Skill Goals**  
*During the activity, students should make progress toward:*

* Analyze mathematical definitions to gain insight into how recursion works. (Critical Thinking)

Models 1 and 2 are based on [Activity 12 - Recursion](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tXPvWq7Zxd0HS4l7tOkB20SjApn8Zj4vwuMtPPrSI0I/pub) by Helen Hu, with modifications by Dee Weikle.


## Facilitation Notes

It's important to let students wrestle with these difficult concepts and not give too much help on individual questions. Keep an eye on questions 1--4, and if a team is getting off track, have them compare answers with a neighboring team.

Report out on #5 and #8 by having teams write their answers on the board. Ideally there will be multiple (incorrect) answers, which will lead to a discussion. Then paste the code in #5 into [Java Visualizer](http://pythontutor.com/java.html) and step through the code as a live demo.

It's possible that Model 1 may take an additional 10-15 minutes, based on how long you report out. After #9, introduce the term **stack overflow** and make the connection to the call stack visualization above.

Model 2 should move a bit faster than Model 1, since it's similar to factorial. Have presenters write their team's solution to #16 on the board. Address misconceptions about variables, parameter passing, and return values.
