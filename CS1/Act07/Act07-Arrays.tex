\maketitle

Programs often need to store multiple values of the same type, such as a list of phone numbers, or the names of your top 20 favorite songs.
Rather than create a separate variable for each one, we can store them together using an array.

\guide{
  \item Explain course/school policies about academic honesty.
  \item Declare and initialize array variables of primitive types.
  \item Draw a memory diagram of an array of reference types.
}{
  \item Justifying answers based on evidence provided in the model. (Problem Solving)
}{
The case studies can be helpful to clarify policies and discuss what is appropriate collaboration vs cheating.
Each team will need a copy of your school's \github{Handouts/jmu-honor-code.pdf}{Honor Code} (or similar document).
Only 15 minutes are allocated for this discussion, but it could last longer if desired.

\ref{array-syntax.tex} introduces arrays for the first time, with a focus on array syntax.
Students learn about declaring, initializing, and using array variables.
Be sure to discuss \ref{arraysta} and \ref{arrayexp} when reporting out.
Explain how Java generally requires the \texttt{new} operator when creating arrays, except in the case of \ref{arraysta}.

In \ref{array-diagrams.tex}, explain that the \texttt{new} operator automatically zeros-out memory for the array.
Therefore, the default value will be 0 for integers, 0.0 for doubles, \texttt{null} for strings, etc.
These values should be present in the team's diagrams.
You may need to remind students that references (i.e., to string objects) are drawn with an arrow.

Key questions: \ref{arrayexp}, \ref{nocopy}, \ref{draw3str}
