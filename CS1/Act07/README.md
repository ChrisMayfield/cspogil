## Facilitation Notes

When reporting out Model 2, have teams predict the answers to numbers Questions 11, 12, and 15. Then execute the code and have them discuss their results, if incorrect.

On Question 22, students may forget to use a `long` variable to store the factorial. If time permits, show the output of the solution when `fact` is declared as `int`.
