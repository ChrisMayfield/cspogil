# Activity 8: Instructor's Guide

This activity introduces arrays for the first time, with a focus on array syntax and memory diagrams.
Students learn about zero-based indexing array processing using loops.

**Content Learning Objectives**  
*After completing this activity, students should be able to:*

* Declare and initialize array variables of primitive types.
* Draw a memory digram of an array of reference types.
* Write a for loop that iterates the contents of an array.

**Process Skill Goals**  
*During the activity, students should make progress toward:*

* Identify how to loop through two arrays to compute a result. (Problem Solving)

**Acknowledgements**  
Model 1 is based on [Activity 13 - TwoD Arrays](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tXPvWq7Zxd0HS4l7tOkB20SjApn8Zj4vwuMtPPrSI0I/pub) by Helen Hu.

## Facilitation Notes

Be sure to discuss #4 and #5 while reporting out. Students often confuse **expressions** with **statements**. Explain how Java generally requires the `new` operator when creating arrays.

In Model 2, explain how the `new` operator automatically zeros-out memory for the array. Therefore, the default value will be 0 for integers, 0.0 for doubles, null for strings, etc.

Students may have the most trouble with Model 3, particularly if writing code on paper. One way to jump start the process is to report out before teams write their solution. Give each team 2--3 minutes to develop an algorithm and have the presenter describe it to the class. If short on time, have half of the teams work on #11 and the other half work on #12.
