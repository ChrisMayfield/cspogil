## Facilitation Notes

Report out on Question 3 and make connections to previous activities about strings and arrays. Note that when drawing strings in the future, students will not need to use this level of detail. Point out that methods from the String class make it much easier to manipulate character arrays.

Question 11 introduces the concept of `this` as an implicit argument. It may help to show students an incorrect static way of designing these methods, for example: `String.charAt(str, 8)`. Both parameters (`str` and `8`) are necessary, but the object-oriented way is simpler: `str.charAt(8)` where `str` becomes `this`.
