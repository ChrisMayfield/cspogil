The \java{String} class provides methods for working with text.
The \java{Random} class provides methods for generating random numbers.
In this activity, you'll learn how to make your own classes that represent everyday objects.

\guide{
  \item Define the terms: attribute, method, constructor, instance.
  \item Implement non-static methods based on a UML diagram.
  \item Distinguish between static, instance, parameter, and local variables.
}{
  \item Writing method signatures exactly as specified in a UML diagram. (Information Processing)
}{
\ref{die-class.tex} is primarily about introducing object-oriented vocabulary.
As you walk around, keep an eye on \ref{dievar}.
Some students may incorrectly write \texttt{int lucky}, and if that happens, have them re-read the text in \ref{die-class.tex}.
For reporting out, have presenters of neighboring teams compare their answers and ask questions as needed.

\ref{circle-class.tex} asks students to implement a \texttt{Circle} class, one method at a time.
After they complete \ref{circmain}, show Circle.java on the projector and step through the code beginning from \texttt{main}.
It may be helpful to use \href{http://pythontutor.com/java.html}{Java Tutor} to illustrate how \texttt{Circle} objects are created on the heap.

\ref{variable-scope.tex} presents a slightly different circle class named \texttt{SwapCircle}.
Have students work through the first questions as quickly as possible so they can spend time on \ref{predict}.
You'll need about ten minutes at the end of class to walk students through the solution, again using Java Tutor or similar tool.
