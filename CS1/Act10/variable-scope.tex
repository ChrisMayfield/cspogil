\model{Variable Scope}
% based on Model 1 of "Improved Scope" activity by Helen Hu

As a team, review and discuss the provided \textit{SwapCircle.java} and \textit{SwapDriver.java} source files.
Then identify the \emph{scope} of each variable (i.e., where it can base used) based on the table below.

\Q Identify one static variable from the \java{SwapCircle} class.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the name and purpose of the variable?
\\ \ans{\java{circleCount} -- tracks the number of \java{SwapCircle} objects that have been created}

\item What is the scope of the variable?
\\ \ans{{\tt private static} -- it can be used anywhere within the \java{SwapCircle} class only}

\item What is one example of somewhere it cannot be used?
\\ \ans{\tt SwapDriver.main}
\end{enumerate}


\Q Identify one instance variable from the \java{SwapCircle} class.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the name and purpose of the variable?
\\ \ans{\java{radius} -- stores the radius of {\tt this} SwapCircle}

\item What is the scope of the variable?
\\ \ans{{\tt private} and non-{\tt static} -- it can only be used in \java{SwapCircle} in non-static contexts}

\item What is one example of somewhere it cannot be used?
\\ \ans{\tt SwapDriver.main}
\end{enumerate}


\Q Identify one parameter from the \java{SwapCircle} class.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the name and purpose of the variable? \\[2pt]
\ans{Possible answers include: \java{radius} (in the constructor), \java{x} and \java{y}, \java{c1} and \java{c2}}

\item What is the scope of the variable? \\[2pt]
\ans{The variable exists throughout the entire method (but not other methods).}

\item Where can the variable not be used? \\[2pt]
\ans{It can't be used in other methods, e.g., you can't refer to \java{x} in \java{swapCircles}.}
\end{enumerate}


\Q Identify one local variable from the \java{SwapCircle} class.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the name and purpose of the variable? \\[2pt]
\ans{Possible answers include: \java{temp} and \java{r} (both used for swapping values)}

\item What is the scope of the variable? \\[2pt]
\ans{The variable exists from when it's declared until the end of the method.}

\item Where can the variable not be used? \\[2pt]
\ans{It cannot be used in other methods and/or before it has been declared.}
\end{enumerate}


%\Q \label{predict}
%In the space below, predict the result of the \java{SwapDriver} program.
%How might \java{swapInts} and \java{swapCircles} behave differently?
%
%\begin{answer}
%Answers will vary.
%The \java{swapInts} method is using primitive values, and the \java{swapCircles} method is using references.
%\end{answer}


\Q \label{summary}
Run the \java{SwapDriver} program and summarize what you learn based on the output.

\begin{answer}
Answers will vary.
The primitive integers were not swapped, but the attributes of the \java{Circle} objects were.
The \jans{static circleCount} kept track of how many objects were created.
\end{answer}


\Q Notice that \java{getRadius} returns \java{this.radius} (from \java{this} object).
In contrast, \java{getCircleCount} does not use the keyword \java{this}.
Why not?

\begin{answer}
getCircleCount is a static method, so there is no object.
If you try to use \jans{this}, you will get a compiler error that says, ``non-static variable this cannot be referenced from a static context''.
\end{answer}


\Q Identify an example of where an instance variable is used within a static method.

\begin{enumerate}
\item In which method does this occur? \\[2pt]
\ans{\java{radius} is used in the \java{swapCircles} method}

\item Why is the method able to access these instance variables, even though they are private? \\[2pt]
\ans{\java{swapCircles} belongs to the \java{SwapCircle} class}

\item Explain how this method is not a violation of the rule that instance variables cannot be accessed inside a static method. \\[1ex]
\ans{You can't use {\tt this}.radius in a {\tt static} method, but it's okay to use \java{c1.radius}}
\end{enumerate}
