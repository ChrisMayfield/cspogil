\maketitle

Previously we explored how classes define attributes and methods.
Static variables and methods apply to the whole class, whereas non-static variables and methods apply to specific objects.

\guide{
  \item Discuss benefits of POGIL for student learning.
  \item Explain the purpose of constructor, accessor, and mutator methods.
  \item Implement the equals and toString methods for a given class design.
  \item Design a new class (UML diagram) based on a general description.
}{
  \item Identifying attributes and data types that model a real-world object. (Problem Solving)
}{
\ref{pogil-research.tex} is a meta activity designed to reestablish buy-in near the end of the semester.
Be sure to explain why you are using POGIL in your classroom and how it benefits students.
The figures and sample solutions are from Moog (2014), found in Chapter 8 of \href{http://dx.doi.org/10.7936/K7PN93HC}{Integrating Cognitive Science with Innovative Teaching in STEM Disciplines}.

\ref{common-methods.tex} begins with questions about constructors, getters, and setters.
Report out on \ref{immutable} as soon as the majority teams have made it that far.
Reinforce the concept of immutable objects, and point out that the \java{java.lang.String} class is designed this way.

The questions immediately after \ref{expr} require students to understand the source code of \java{equals} and \java{toString}.
If this is the first time they have seen language features like \java{Object}, \texttt{instanceof}, and \java{String.format}, you may want to give a 5-minute lecture (but avoid giving the answers).

When reporting out \ref{credit-card.tex}, have presenters write their designs on the board.
Compare the trade-offs of their different designs.
For example, to store credit card numbers some teams may use strings, others may use arrays of integers, and some may use a \texttt{long} variable (\texttt{int} won't work because of the range).
