Previously we explored how classes define attributes and methods.
Static variables and methods apply to the whole class, whereas non-static variables and methods apply to specific objects.
%In this activity, we'll take a closer look at what objects look like.

\guide{
  \item Discuss benefits of POGIL for student learning.
  \item Explain the purpose of constructor, accessor, and mutator methods.
  \item Implement the equals and toString methods for a given class design.
  \item Design a new class (UML diagram) based on a general description.
}{
  \item Identifying key attributes and data types that model a real-world object. (Problem Solving)

TODO

Ask the managers to pace their team on Model 1; they will need to work quickly.
Set aside 10 minutes between Models 1 and 2 to step through Circle.java using \href{http://pythontutor.com/java.html}{Java Tutor} or similar tool.
Have the recorder document team misconceptions on his/her activity sheet.

When reporting out Model 2, have presenters write their designs on whiteboards.
Compare the trade-offs of different designs: to store credit card numbers, some teams may use strings, others arrays, some int/long.

%TODO add new model for equals and toString
