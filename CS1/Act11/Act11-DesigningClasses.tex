\maketitle

Previously we explored how classes define attributes and methods.
Static variables and methods apply to the whole class, whereas non-static variables and methods apply to specific objects.

\guide{
  \item Discuss benefits of POGIL for student learning.
  \item Explain the purpose of constructor, accessor, and mutator methods.
  \item Implement the equals and toString methods for a given class design.
  \item Design a new class (UML diagram) based on a general description.
}{
  \item Identifying key attributes and data types that model a real-world object. (Problem Solving)

TODO

When reporting out \ref{credit-card.tex}, have presenters write their designs on the board.
Compare the trade-offs of their different designs.
For example, to store credit card numbers some teams may use strings, others may use arrays of integers, and some may use a \texttt{long} variable (\texttt{int} won't work because of the range).
}

%TODO add new model for equals and toString
