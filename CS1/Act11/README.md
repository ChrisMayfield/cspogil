## Facilitation Notes

Ask the managers to pace their team on Model 1; they will need to work quickly. Set aside 10 minutes between Models 1 and 2 to step through Circle.java using Java Tutor (http://pythontutor.com/java.html) or similar tool. Have the recorder document team misconceptions on his/her activity sheet.

When reporting out Model 2, have presenters write their designs on whiteboards. Compare the trade-offs of different designs: to store credit card numbers, some teams may use strings, others arrays, some int/long.
