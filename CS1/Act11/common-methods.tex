\model{Common Methods}

Classes are often used to represent abstract data types, such as \java{Color} or \java{Point}.
They are also used to represent objects in the real world, such as \java{CreditCard} (see \ref{credit-card.tex}) or \java{Person}.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{Color.pdf}  % immutable
~~~~~
\includegraphics{Point.pdf}  % mutable
\end{center}

Classes generally include the following kinds of methods (in addition to others):
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt]
\item \textbf{constructor} methods that initialize new objects
\item \textbf{accessor} methods (getters) that return attributes
\item \textbf{mutator} methods (setters) that modify attributes
\item \textbf{object} methods such as \java{equals} and \java{toString}
\item \textbf{utility} methods which are generally static
\end{itemize}

\Q Identify the constructors for the \java{Color} class. What is the difference between them? What arguments do they take?

\begin{answer}
There are two constructors: one that takes three integers for the RGB values, and other that takes a Color object. The latter is called a \emph{copy constructor}. Constructors do not return values.
\end{answer}


\Q Identify an accessor method in the \java{Point} class.
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=1pt]
\item Which instance variable does it get? \ans{{\tt this.x} or {\tt this.y}}
\item What arguments does the method take? \ans{none}
\item What does the method return? \ans{The value of \java{x} or \java{y}}
\end{enumerate}


\Q Identify a mutator method in the \java{Point} class.
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=1pt]
\item Which instance variable does it set? \ans{{\tt this.x} or {\tt this.y}}
\item What arguments does the method take? \ans{The value of \java{x} or \java{y}}
\item What does the method return? \ans{nothing}
\end{enumerate}
