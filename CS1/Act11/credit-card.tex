\Q Describe how you would implement the \java{equals} and \java{toString} methods of the \java{CreditCard} class (i.e., what you would define them to return based on which attributes).

\begin{answer}[5em]
Two credit cards would be considered equal if they have the same account number, assuming there are no duplicates in the bank.
The \java{toString} would print the account number, expiration date, and cardholder's name, each separated by a comma.
\end{answer}
