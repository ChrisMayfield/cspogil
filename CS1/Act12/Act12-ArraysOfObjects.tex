\maketitle

With arrays and objects, you can represent pretty much any type of data.
It's not only possible to have arrays of objects, but also objects of arrays, objects of objects, arrays of arrays, arrays of objects of arrays, and so forth.

\guide{
  \item Explain the differences when instantiating an array and an object.
  \item Rewrite a for loop (over an array) using an enhanced for loop.
  \item Use enhanced for loops to construct and search arrays of objects.
}{
  \item Developing algorithms for constructing and searching arrays of objects. (Problem Solving)
}{
TODO

This activity makes use of a simple Card class.
Be sure to take a look at the source code before facilitating.
It stores both the rank and suit as integers, and it does not perform any validation.

Question \#9 can optionally be extended by having students call a setter method that performs validation.
That way, this.rank is guaranteed to be between 1 and 13, and this.suit between 0 and 3.
