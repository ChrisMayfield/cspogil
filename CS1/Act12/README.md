## Facilitation Notes

This activity makes use of a simple Card class. Be sure to take a look at the source code before facilitating. It stores both the rank and suit as integers, and it doesn not perform any validation.

Question #9 can optinally be extended by having students call a setter method that performs validation. That way, this.rank is guaranteed to be between 1 and 13, and this.suit between 0 and 3.
