\maketitle

When tracing code by hand, it's helpful to draw a picture to keep track of variables, methods, and objects.
Memory diagrams represent the state of a program at a particular moment in time.

\rolenames

\guide{
  \item Describe primitive values and references in a memory diagram.
  \item Draw memory diagrams that have variables, arrays and objects.
  \item Summarize differences between variables, arrays, and objects.
}{
  \item Leveraging prior knowledge and experience of other students. (Teamwork)
}{
Discussion:
\\ $*$ Variables -- all boxes are the "same" size (8 bytes or less)
\\ $*$ Pass int to a method, and it doesn't get changed in main
\\ $*$ Pass array to a method, and it gets changed (same object)

Misconceptions:
\\ $*$ Cannot have a reference to a variable (on the stack or heap)
\\ $*$ Assigning variable does not create a new box (only declaring)
\\ $*$ Assigning reference does not create a new object (only "new")

Note on strings:
\\ $*$ Shorthand -- for convenience, objects may be drawn toString

Key questions: \ref{key1}, \ref{key2}, \ref{key3}
