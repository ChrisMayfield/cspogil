\maketitle

In Java, a multidimensional array is an array whose elements are themselves arrays.
You can declare an ``array of arrays'' by using two or more sets of brackets, such as \java{String[][]}.

  \item Write nested for loops to traverse a two-dimensional array.
  \item Explain differences between rectangular and ragged arrays.
  \item Use two-dimensional arrays to model real-world problems.
}{
  \item Rewriting a group of repetitive statements as a for loop. (Information Processing)

Encourage the presenters and recorders to work together on the second half of \ref{model1.tex}.
For example, the presenter can send the final code to the recorder, or the recorder can simply retype everything the presenter does in real time.
