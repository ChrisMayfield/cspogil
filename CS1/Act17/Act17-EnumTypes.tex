\ref{model1.tex}: Remind students how to use JShell, especially tab completion and the up/down arrow keys.
Encourage students to predict and discuss the results as a team while they run each line of code in JShell.

\ref{model2.tex}: Note that the provided files contain additional code than is in the model.
Tell students to focus on the code in the activity, but they can use the source files to try other examples.

Key questions: \ref{key1}, \ref{key2}, \ref{key3}
