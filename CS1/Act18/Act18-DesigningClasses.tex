\maketitle

When starting a software project, one of the first steps is to determine requirements.
Next comes designing, which for object-oriented languages involves turning requirements into classes.

\rolenames

\guide{
  \item Explain the differences between classes, objects, and their attributes.
  \item Design a new class (in UML syntax) based on a general description.
  \item Draw a UML diagram that consists of multiple interrelated classes.
}{
  \item Identifying attributes and data types that model a real-world object. (Problem Solving)
}{
Point out that classes can be used to represent objects in the real world (such as a picture, animal, person, or car).
They can also be used to represent abstract concepts (such as a color, word, or Scanner, or StringBuilder).

When designing classes for the first time, it might be easier to consider objects in the real world.
Identifying appropriate data fields for real-world objects is more straightforward (less abstract).
