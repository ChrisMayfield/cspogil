\maketitle

The \textit{Java Collections Framework} provides many useful interfaces, implementations (classes), and algorithms (methods).
They all serve the same purpose: to store a collection of multiple objects.
But each type of collection has its own trade-offs, and there is no one ``best solution'' for every storage problem.
If arrays were good enough, Java wouldn't need a collections framework.

%\medskip
%Today you will learn one of the most fundamental concepts of data structures: whether to store elements in contiguous memory locations (arrays), or link elements together using references.

  \item Show the contents of a List after adding and removing elements.
  \item Summarize performance trade-offs for ArrayList and LinkedList.
  \item Explain why Java's implementation of LinkedList is doubly-linked.

  \item Making connections between linked list diagrams and Java source code. (Information Processing)
