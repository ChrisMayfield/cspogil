\maketitle

Arrays and lists are straightforward for storing a collection of objects.
In this activity, you'll gain experience with two other kinds of collections.
Sets and maps are quite useful for implementing a wide variety of algorithms.

  \item Summarize methods in the \java{Set} interface.
  \item Summarize methods in the \java{Map} interface
  \item Explain differences between sets and maps.
}{
  \item Discuss results while running code interactively. (Oral Communication)
}{
When reporting out \ref{model1.tex}, point out there are no get/set methods.
Discuss example uses of sets (e.g., eliminating duplicates, testing membership, comparing differences).

When reporting out \ref{model2.tex}, compare maps with sets.
For example, maps have a \java{get} method, but sets have \java{contains}.
Discuss example uses of maps (e.g., counting words in a document).
