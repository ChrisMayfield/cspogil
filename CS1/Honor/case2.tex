\section*{Case Study: A Friend Indeed}

Jeffrey was having trouble with one of the last programming assignments.
He didn't even know where to begin and it was already late.
Another student, Stephen, lived in his hall and Jeff was pretty friendly with him.
Jeff went to Stephen's room and told him that his computer was acting flaky.
He asked if could he borrow Stephen's laptop to finish up the program?
Stephen was on his way out to dinner and told him okay.
When he got back Jeffrey was gone.

While Stephen was out, Jeffrey searched for and located the code for the assignment on Stephen's machine.
Jeffrey copied it onto his flash drive and took it back to his room, where he modified the code a bit before submitting it for a grade.
