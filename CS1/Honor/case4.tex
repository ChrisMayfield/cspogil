\section*{Case Study: Too Close for Comfort}

Bill and Jeff were two freshman rooming together in the fall semester and were taking CS 139.
Bill was an excellent student for whom the work in CS 139 seemed to come easily.
Jeff seemed to struggle a bit more, but was able to do the work and turned most labs and programs in on time.

Both programs came in looking virtually the same.
When confronted, Jeff claimed the work as his own and stated that he did not know how the code from the roommates was the same.
Later Bill told the professor that while programming was easy for him, he had struggled with another class and then got behind with this program.
He didn't think the professor would find out and so stole his roommate's code and turned that in.
