\section*{Case Study: Let's Make a Deal}

It was mid-semester and the pressure was on, not only in CS but in other classes.
Jamie and Pat were each working on the programming assignment in the lab, but neither was having much success.
Jamie had started several days ago, but he was having trouble debugging his current work.
Pat had just started that day and knew that she would be turning it in late.
Regardless, Pat offered to help Jamie work out the problems with his code.

Together, and after a couple of hours of work, they got the program to work.
Pat said, ``Now that yours is working, can you give me the code so that I can also get credit for this assignment?''
When Jamie objected, Pat said, ``Hey, you wouldn't have gotten it finished if it weren't for my help, and now mine will be even later!''
So Jamie turned over a copy of the code.
Pat made some changes to a few sections, and then turned in the final program.
