\section*{Case Study: A Friendly Assist}

George was struggling with the programming assignment on the night it was due.
He had gone home over the weekend before, thinking that it would be easy to do this assignment, but it turned out to be more difficult than he thought.
After working on some parts of it and giving up in frustration, he turned to Shelley, a senior CS student who had taken the course several semesters before.
He showed Shelley the assignment, and the two of them worked on it late into the night.
They successfully submitted the program with a late penalty of only one day.
