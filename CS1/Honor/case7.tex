\section*{Case Study: A Team Effort}

Stan, Jane, and Tom were part of a project team.
At the start of the semester they all agreed to be responsible for everything that was submitted by their project.
As the project got underway, they divided up the work and decided to complete and submit the three parts individually.
Tom was behind on his work as the deadline approached, and so as not to be late he copied several pages from files of a roommate who had completed the same work last year.
The team project was submitted on time, though only 2/3 of it was original work.
