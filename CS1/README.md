# About CS1

This folder contains activities for CS 149 and CS 159 at James Madison University.
CS 149 focuses on the fundamentals, and CS 159 focuses on object-oriented programming.
Together, they present the traditional [CS1](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1734263.1734335) curriculum along with a few other topics.

Each subfolder contains the LaTeX source for the activity.
Use the build.py script to compile student and teacher PDFs.
(e.g., `python build.py CS1 Act01`)
