\model{Designing a Class}

Classes are often used to represent abstract data types, such as \java{Color} or \java{String}.
They are also used to represent objects in the real world, such as a \java{Person} or \java{CreditCard}.
%UML class diagrams summarize the attributes and methods of a class.

\end{center}

Classes generally include the following kinds of methods:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt]
\item \textbf{constructor} methods that initialize new objects
\item \textbf{accessor} methods (getters) that return attributes
\item \textbf{mutator} methods (setters) that modify attributes
\item \textbf{object} methods such as \java{equals} and \java{toString}
\item \textbf{utility} methods which are generally static
\end{itemize}

\Q Identify a constructor in the \java{Color} class. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item What arguments do the method take?
\item What does the method return?
\end{enumerate}


\Q Identify an accessor method in the \java{Color} class. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Which instance variable does it get?
\item What arguments does the method take?
\item What does the method return?
\end{enumerate}


\Q Identify a mutator method in the \java{Color} class.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Which instance variable does it set?
\item What arguments does the method take?
\item What does the method return?
\end{enumerate}
