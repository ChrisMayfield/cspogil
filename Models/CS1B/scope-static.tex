\model{Variable Scope}

Study the \java{Circle} and \java{SwapDriver} classes included at the end of the questions.
For each variable, identify its \emph{scope} based on the table below.

\begin{center}
\small
\begin{tabular}{|L{95pt}|L{125pt}|L{115pt}|L{105pt}|}
\hline
\tr &
\tr \textbf{Where declared?} &
\tr \textbf{Where used?} &
\tr \textbf{Example} \\
\hline
\textbf{static variables} \par (``class variables'') &
declared outside of all methods (typically at the start of the class) &
anywhere in the class (or in other classes if also \java{public}) &
\java{circleCount} in the \java{Circle} class \\
\hline
\textbf{instance variables} \par (``attributes'') &
declared outside of all methods (typically after any static variables) &
any non-static method (or in static methods when another object has been created) &
\java{radius} in the \java{Circle} class \\
\hline
\textbf{parameters} &
declared inside the ()'s of a method signature &
anywhere within the method where they are declared &
\java{radius} in the \java{Circle} constructor \\
\hline
\textbf{local variables} &
declared inside a method (or inside another block of code, like a \java{for} loop) &
anywhere within the method or code block after they are declared &
\java{temp} in the \java{swapInts} method \\

\Q Identify one static variable from the Circle class.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the variable name of the static variable, and how is it being used?
\item What is the scope of the variable?
\item What is one example of somewhere it cannot be used?
\end{enumerate}


\Q Identify one static variable from the SwapDriver class. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the variable name of the static variable? 
\item What is the scope of the variable, and why does it differ from your answer to the previous question?
\item What syntax would you use to access to this variable in the Circle class?
\end{enumerate}


\Q Identify one instance variable from the two files. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the variable name of the instance variable?
\item What is the scope of the variable?
\item What is one example of somewhere it cannot be used?
\end{enumerate}


\Q Identify a local variable from the Circle class.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the variable name of the local variable? 
\item What is the scope of the variable?
\item Where can the variable not be used?
\end{enumerate}


\Q Identify a local variable from the SwapDriver class that is \emph{not} declared at the start of the method.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the variable name of the local variable? 
\item What is the scope of the variable?
\item Where can the variable not be used?
\end{enumerate}


\Q Identify a variable that is declared inside a code block in the Circle class.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the variable name of the local variable? 
\item What is the scope of the variable?
\item Where can the variable not be used?
\end{enumerate}


%\Q Of the four kinds of variable listed in the above Model, which variables were labeled with the access modifiers public and private? Describe in your own words what the words public and private allow you to control.


\Q Review your answers to earlier questions and make sure you know which variables are instance variables. Identify an example of where an instance variable is used within a static method.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What method does this occur in? 
\item Explain how this is not a violation of the rule that instance variables cannot be accessed inside a static method.
\end{enumerate}
