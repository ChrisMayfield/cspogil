\model{Case Study: Panic Attack}

Frank was behind in his programming assignment.
He approached Martin to see if he could get some help.
But he was so far behind and so confused that Martin just gave him his code with the intent that he would ``just look at it to get some ideas.''

In the paraphrased words of Frank: ``I started the assignment three days after you put it up.
But then other assignments came in and I started on them too.
I felt like I was chasing rabbits and began to panic.
It was already past the due date and I got really scared.
That's when I went to Martin to see if he could help.''
Frank copied much of the code and turned it in as his own.
