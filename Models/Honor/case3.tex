\model{Case Study: Oops}

Emily was working in the lab on her programming assignment.
She finally finished the program and submitted it and went on to do some other work.
Shortly thereafter, she left the lab.

\vspace{1em}

Another student, Kyle, was working nearby.
He knew that she had successfully submitted the assignment, and he had not been able to get his to work properly.
When Emily left, he noticed that she had not logged out of her computer.
He moved to her workstation, found the work under her Documents directory, and copied it onto his memory stick.
He then logged out, logged in as himself, and copied the code onto his Desktop where he modified the program a bit, then successfully submitted it.
