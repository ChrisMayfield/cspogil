\model{Case Study: Let's Make a Deal}

It was mid-semester and the pressure was on, not only in CS 139, but in other classes as well.
Two students, Jamie and Pat were working on the programming test in the lab, but neither was having much success.
Jamie had started the program days ago, but was having trouble debugging his current work.
Pat had just started this day and knew that she would be late in turning it in.
Pat offered to help Jamie work out the problems with his code.

Together and after a couple of hours of work, they got the program to work.
Pat said, ``Now that yours is working, can you give me the code so that I can also get credit for this assignment.''
When Jamie objected, Pat said, ``Hey, you wouldn't have gotten it finished if it weren't for my help, and now mine will be even later.''
So Jamie turned over a copy of the code.
Pat made some changes to a few sections, and then turned the program in.
