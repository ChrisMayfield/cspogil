\model{Case Study: A Friendly Assist}

George was struggling with the latest programming assignment that was due to be submitted that night.
He had gone home over the weekend, thinking that it would be easy to do this assignment, but it turned out to be more difficult than he thought.
After working on some parts of it and giving up in frustration he turned to Shelley, a senior CS student who had taken 139 several
semesters before.
He showed Shelley the assignment and the two of them worked on it late into the night.
It was successfully submitted with only a one day late penalty.
