# cspogil

**This repository of POGIL activities for intro CS is a work in progress. The first release will be after December 2016.**

Many authors have contributed to these activities, including Chris Mayfield, Helen Hu, Clif Kussmaul, and others. See individual source files for specific attribution.

The activities in this repository are written in LaTeX. Each source file contains a single model and its accompanying critical thinking questions. Activities are built and customized by including a sequence of models.

You can browse each of the activities and models separately. The provided Makefile recursively builds PDF versions of each source file.
