The documents in this repository are written in LaTeX.
Each source file contains a single model and its accompanying critical thinking questions.
Activities are designed by including (with \input) a sequence of models.

You can browse each of the models and activities separately.
The build.py script compiles student and teacher PDFs for each LaTeX source file.
