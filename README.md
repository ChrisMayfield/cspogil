**This repository of POGIL activities for computer science is a work in progress. The first release will be after December 2016.**

Many authors have contributed to these activities, including Chris Mayfield, Helen Hu, Clif Kussmaul, and others. See individual source files for specific attribution.

The documents in this repository are written in LaTeX. Each source file contains a single model and its accompanying critical thinking questions. Activities are designed by including (with \input) a sequence of models.

You can browse each of the models and activities separately. The build.py script compiles student and teacher PDFs for each LaTeX source file.
