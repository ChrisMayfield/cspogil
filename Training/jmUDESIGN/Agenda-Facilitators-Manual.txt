TODO next year:
20 minutes for each model?
end of model 2: reflector report to team
end of model 4: report out on the board


Tuesday, 9:30 -- 11:00

This activity will highlight the supplemental readings with a more in-depth review of learning taxonomies, as well as to discuss differentiation between outcomes, goals, and objectives.

At the end of this activity, you will be able to:
* Explain the difference between goals, objectives, outcomes
* Articulate and justify your choice of a learning taxonomy
* Identify characteristics of measurable learning objectives
* Create (or revise) the learning objectives for your course

==== 10 min: POGIL Implementation

See "Instructions for Manager"

==== 15 min: Statements of Learning

The literature is full of terminology such as "mission", "goals", "objectives", and "outcomes", but lacking in consensus on a precise meaning of each of these terms.

• Orient participants to the difference between goals, outcomes, and objectives

==== 15 min: Bloom's Taxonomy

• Confirm for participants that taxonomies provide a language and structure for writing educational objectives

• Ask participants to classify four learning objectives according to the Bloom's level

==== 15 min: Finks's Taxonomy

• Engage participants in a discussion of the pros and cons of different learning taxonomies

==== 15 min: Course Objectives

• Ask participants to identify the worst learning objective from a list

• Ask participants to identify the best learning objective from a list

This and the previous two prompts will build a list of "good characteristics" of objectives.

==== 20 min: Working Time

• Present opportunities for participants to participate and interact; also allow time for participants to start working on an objective
